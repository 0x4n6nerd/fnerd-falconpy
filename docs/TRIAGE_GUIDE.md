# 4n6NerdStriker Triage Guide

**Version**: 1.3.0  
**Last Updated**: June 8, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Production Ready

## Overview

The Triage feature in 4n6NerdStriker v1.3.0 provides automated, concurrent forensic collection across mixed environments with automatic OS detection. This eliminates the need to manually determine whether to use KAPE (Windows) or UAC (Unix/Linux/macOS) for each host.

## Key Features

- **Automatic OS Detection**: Determines platform from hostname and selects appropriate collection method
- **Concurrent Execution**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel collections across multiple hosts
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-configured profiles optimized for incident response
- **Custom Override**: Full customization of profiles and targets per collection
- **Production Stable**: Built on proven KAPE and UAC collectors with 100% success rates

## Basic Usage

### Single Host Triage
```bash
# Auto-detect OS and use default profiles
4n6nerdstriker triage -n 1 -d hostname

# With custom profiles
4n6nerdstriker triage -n 1 -d hostname -p network_compromise -t EmergencyTriage
```

### Multi-Host Triage from File
```bash
# Process all hosts in file with auto-detection
4n6nerdstriker triage -f mixed_hosts.txt

# With batch processing and concurrency control
4n6nerdstriker triage -f mixed_hosts.txt --batch --max-concurrent 5

# With custom profiles
4n6nerdstriker triage -f mixed_hosts.txt -p ir_triage_no_hash -t !BasicCollection
```

### Host File Format
Create a simple text file with one hostname per line:
```
# mixed_hosts.txt
windows-srv-01
linux-web-02
macos-laptop-03
unix-db-04
```

## Default Profiles

The triage feature uses optimized defaults for rapid incident response:

| Platform | Default Target/Profile | Collection Time | Description |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Windows | !SANS_TRIAGE | 35 minutes | Comprehensive Windows triage |
| Unix/Linux/macOS | ir_triage_no_hash | 35-40 minutes | Full IR without hashing overhead |

## Performance Characteristics

### Single Host Performance
| Platform | Collection Time | Data Size | Success Rate |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Windows (KAPE) | 2-35 minutes | 100MB-2GB | 100% (11/11 targets) |
| Unix/Linux/macOS (UAC) | 15-90 minutes | 50MB-1GB | 100% (8/8 profiles) |

### Concurrent Performance
| Hosts | Sequential Time | Concurrent Time | Speedup |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| 5 mixed | 3-5 hours | 45-90 minutes | 4-5x |
| 10 mixed | 6-10 hours | 60-120 minutes | 6-8x |
| 20 mixed | 12-20 hours | 90-180 minutes | 8-12x |

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Profile/Target Combinations
```bash
# Mixed environment with specific requirements
4n6nerdstriker triage -f enterprise_hosts.txt \
  -p malware_hunt_fast \
  -t MalwareAnalysis \
  --batch \
  --max-concurrent 10
```

### Platform-Specific Override
```bash
# Force specific collections (bypasses auto-detection)
4n6nerdstriker kape -f windows_hosts.txt -t !BasicCollection --batch
4n6nerdstriker uac -f unix_hosts.txt -p quick_triage_optimized --batch
```

## OS Detection Logic

The triage system automatically detects platform using the following logic:

1. **Query CrowdStrike API** for host platform information
2. **Map to collection method**:
   - `Windows` â†’ KAPE collection with specified target
   - `Linux`, `Mac`, `Unix` â†’ UAC collection with specified profile
3. **Apply defaults** if no custom profile/target specified
4. **Execute using proven methods** from individual collectors

## Available Profiles and Targets

| Target | Time | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| !BasicCollection | 20m | Essential Windows forensics |

| quick_triage_optimized | 15-20m | Essential artifacts only |
| network_compromise | 25-30m | Network intrusion focus |
| ir_triage_no_hash | 35-40m | Full IR without hashing |
| malware_hunt_fast | 45-50m | Malware with selective hashing |
| ir_triage | 79m | Complete IR triage |
| full | 6h | Comprehensive collection |

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Automatic Retry Logic
- Failed collections automatically retry once
- Session management prevents timeouts during long operations
- Emergency cleanup removes artifacts from target systems

### Mixed Environment Handling
```bash
# Continue on errors (don't stop batch on single failure)
4n6nerdstriker triage -f mixed_hosts.txt --continue-on-error

# Detailed logging for troubleshooting
4n6nerdstriker triage -f mixed_hosts.txt --log-level DEBUG
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Host not found | Incorrect hostname | Verify hostname exactly matches CrowdStrike |
| Session timeout | Long-running collection | Increase timeout or use lighter profile |
| Upload failure | Network/S3 issue | Check AWS credentials and bucket permissions |
| Platform detection failure | API error | Use explicit kape/uac commands instead |

## Best Practices

### For Incident Response
1. **Start with triage**: Use default profiles for rapid assessment
2. **Scale appropriately**: Use 5-10 concurrent hosts for most environments
3. **Monitor progress**: Enable detailed logging for large operations
4. **Plan storage**: Ensure adequate S3 bucket space for collections

### For Forensic Investigations
1. **Use targeted profiles**: Select profiles matching investigation needs
2. **Preserve evidence**: All collections include chain of custody metadata
3. **Document decisions**: Use custom reasons for collection justification
4. **Verify uploads**: S3 verification ensures successful evidence preservation

### Performance Optimization
1. **Choose appropriate profiles**: Use lighter profiles for quick wins
2. **Limit concurrency**: Don't exceed 10-15 concurrent hosts
3. **Monitor resources**: Watch API rate limits and system performance
4. **Batch operations**: Always use --batch flag for multiple hosts

## Integration Examples

### Python API
```python
from forensics_nerdstriker.cli.main import process_triage_concurrent

# Process mixed environment
hosts = ['win-srv-01', 'linux-web-02', 'macos-laptop-03']
results = process_triage_concurrent(
    orchestrator, 
    hosts, 
    max_concurrent=3,
    uac_profile='network_compromise',
    kape_target='EmergencyTriage'
)

# Check results
for hostname, success in results.items():
    print(f"{hostname}: {'Success' if success else 'Failed'}")
```

### Automated Incident Response
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Rapid incident response across enterprise

# Emergency triage of critical systems
4n6nerdstriker triage -f critical_hosts.txt \
  -p quick_triage_optimized \
  -t EmergencyTriage \
  --batch \
  --max-concurrent 5

# Comprehensive collection of affected systems  
4n6nerdstriker triage -f affected_hosts.txt \
  -p ir_triage_no_hash \
  -t !SANS_Triage \
  --batch \
  --max-concurrent 3
```

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time status updates for each host
- Concurrent execution progress reporting
- S3 upload verification for each collection
- Comprehensive error reporting with suggested remediation

### Logging
```bash
# Enable detailed logging
export FALCON_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
4n6nerdstriker triage -f hosts.txt --log-level DEBUG

# Log to file
4n6nerdstriker triage -f hosts.txt > triage_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1
```

## Security Considerations

### Operational Security
- **Automatic cleanup**: All artifacts removed from target systems
- **Session management**: Proper RTR session handling prevents exposure
- **Credential protection**: API credentials never transmitted to targets
- **Audit trail**: Complete logging of all collection activities

### Evidence Integrity
- **Chain of custody**: Metadata includes collection timestamps and operator
- **Hash verification**: Optional hashing for evidence integrity
- **Secure transport**: All transfers use TLS encryption
- **Access control**: S3 bucket permissions control evidence access

## Conclusion

The 4n6NerdStriker v1.3.0 Triage feature represents the culmination of extensive testing and optimization of both KAPE and UAC collectors. With 100% success rates across all tested targets and profiles, automatic OS detection, and concurrent execution capabilities, it provides a powerful platform for incident response and forensic collection across mixed enterprise environments.

The simplified implementation using proven methods from individual collectors ensures reliability while the concurrent execution provides the speed necessary for effective incident response. Whether conducting emergency triage or comprehensive forensic collection, the triage feature adapts to your environment and scales to your needs.
