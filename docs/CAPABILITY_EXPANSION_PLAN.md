├── detections/     # Detection and incident management
├── intel/          # Threat intelligence
├── forensics/      # Advanced forensics tools
├── response/       # Response actions (isolation, etc.)
├── streaming/      # Event streaming
├── cloud/          # Cloud security features
└── automation/     # Playbook engine
```

### 2. CLI Enhancement

```bash
4n6nerdstriker detections ...
4n6nerdstriker incidents ...
4n6nerdstriker intel ...
4n6nerdstriker forensics ...
4n6nerdstriker response ...
```

### 3. Integration Points
- Maintain compatibility with existing orchestrator
- Reuse authentication and session management
- Extend configuration for new features
- Add new collectors following existing patterns
